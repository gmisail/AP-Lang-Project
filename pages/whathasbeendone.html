Over the past eight years, there has been a significant uptick in the availability of computer science classes. Since 2010, the number of people that have taken AP computer classes went from 19,390 to 99,868, according to the survey done by Google and Gallup ("Searching for Computer Science and Education").  This demonstrates that there has already been a push by schools to increase the opportunities students have to learn computer sciences. In addition, third-party organizations have sprung up to increase interest for and education on topics such as coding and computer sciences. One notable example of these would be <a href="https://code.org/about">Code.org</a>.  According to their website, Code.org is a nonprofit organization that focuses on improving access to computer education, with an emphasis on opportunities for minorities and women. They hold events such as the Hour of Code, where they spend an hour teaching children about programming. Another significant website would be <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> which serves as a teaching tool for anyone interested in learning how to code. They offer comprehensive tutorials in several different coding languages at various different levels.
