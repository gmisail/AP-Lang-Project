The integration of computer science in schools has not been seamless. Many hold the belief that computer science, or programming in particular, should not be enforced in school. Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Operating System and Git, is a notable proponent to this notion. "I actually don't believe that everybody should necessarily try to learn to code" says Torvalds. "I think it's reasonably specialized, and nobody really expects most people to have to do it. It's not like knowing how to read and write and do basic math." Experienced computer scientists like Torvalds believe that programming is an important tool, but it is far too specialized to be a requirement like Mathematics or Biology. Therefore, it should not be enforced as a required class.
